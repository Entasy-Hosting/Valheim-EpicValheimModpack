This is still EARLY ACCESS!! 

What does that mean? 

It can change at any given moment.
There will be much more focus on pushing this to a release candidate rather than adding XYZ feature (features will come later)

For now, It is merely a visual overhaul for the Inventory panel
the container panel
and the split item window


All of these new windows are drag and droppable on your screen.
The inventory window is laid out in a 4x8 format instead of an 8x4 format with scrollable interface

The tooltips also were overhauled in this mod
