>﻿Long ago the great Alchemist Zoe traveled the lands, gathering all the items she could find and testing them in her Alchemy Lab. Her research proved to be successful. She found methods to cure those who were near death.. some believed she had the power to bring back those who are beyond death...

>Her healing methods were also criticized by many, saying she was dealing with forces of evil and her soul was taken by the elder gods as a curse. Zoe hid her findings, she locked herself in a stone tower to keep herself from being hunted by those who found her to be evil. Whispers of her teachings and items passed down from generations, you now have the power to follow in the footsteps of the great Alchemist Zoe!

>To craft the Flasks we need to first make a Potion Cauldron, place 1 Grand

   <h2> About: </h2>

>Potions are scaled in a crafting order to fit right in with the progression of Valheim. Starting with crafting the Alchemy Table and you will be on your way to unlocking the art of potion crafting. Potions will require various materials that you unlock as you progress through Valheim. The new Cauldron allows you to craft advanced potions known as Flasks. By breaking down a "Greater Potion" in the Potion Cauldron you can create a PotionBase Mead that is used to craft the end tier Flasks. You can also place five Flasks, of the same type, into the Potion Cauldron to create a Philosopher's Stone. The Philosopher's Stones will grant additional Alchemy XP gain when crafting, resist of the elemental matching the stone type, and bring you back from the dead consuming the Stone. The Alchemy Skill grants a chance to craft "extra" potions based on your skill level.

<h2> How the crafting bonus works: </h2>

Each level of Alchemy = 1% chance to craft an additional potion. after level 25, your total Alchemy level is divided by 4 and the results is the % chance to crafted a 2nd additional potion. At level 100, you have 100% chance to craft an additional potion and 25% chance to craft a 2nd additional potion on top of that. At 100 a potion that crafts in stacks of x5, if you are lucky could output 7 total items.
